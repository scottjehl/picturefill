Done things:

In general:
Main refactoring including some caches (element specific caches and some global caches).
30+ Test (old had 50 assertions, new has now 80).
Performance increase for reevaluation is now 10x faster. On normal pages with 10-30 images there is
no performance improvement for initialisation (but it's in total just about 2-5ms). Because I needed
to add some additional checks to fix some bugs. But If you use a lot of img/source elements
however the new cache mechanism works and the new picturefill becomes significantly faster
compared to the old version (especially on Safari and IE8+). So it scales much much better.
(I.e. with 100 images about 10 different formats/variations Safari needs 8ms while old picturefill takes about 30ms).
Refactoring also included, that all unit tests can now be run in supporting browsers (Chrome) and I made some
tweaks to also run the unit tests in IE8+.

IMPORTANT/CAUTION
------------------
I relaxed the implementation at one point and really would like to keep it:
It isn't tested anymore, wether the source elements do precede the img tag. I will explain, if you want to change that.

New features:

- Performance (Resize-Performance, "Scale-Performance", Network-Performance see below)
- Does not download a new image,
	- if it has already a better candidate from the same set
	- while window is resized
- Loads new candidates in background for "smooth" Transition between candidates
- addDimensions (option)
- resQuantifier (option)
- Mutationobserver (plugin)
