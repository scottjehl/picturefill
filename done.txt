In general:
Main refactoring for runtime performance. Performance was increased by about 4x for parsing and evaluation. Performance
increase for reevaluation was increased by 10.
Refactoring also included, that all unit tests can also be run in supporting browsers, additionally the picturefill main function
was added to an object, so it can be spied on. (Also good for performance testing).

I relaxed the implementation at one point and really would like to keep it:
It isn't tested anymore, wether the source elements do precede the img tag. I will explain, if you want to change that.

New features:

- Performance
- addDimensions (option)
- resQuantifier (option)
- Mutationobserver (plugin)
