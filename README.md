Picturefill has two versions:
* Version 2 is a strict polyfill of the [Picture element draft specification](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/embedded-content.html#embedded-content) and is the main version in development.
* Version 1 mimics the Picture element pattern with `span` elements. It is maintained in the 1.2 branch.
